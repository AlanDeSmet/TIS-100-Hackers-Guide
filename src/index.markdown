Introduction
============

The TIS-100 Hacker's Guide is for people intrested in the guts of TIS-100.

   * [Puzzle Lua](lua.html) documents how TIS-100 interacts with puzzles written in Lua, for use both by puzzles creators and emulator creators.

       * [math.random() and math.randomseed()](random.html) documents how TIS-100's versions of those functions behave and can be reproduced.

       * [Lua Style](lua-style.html) documents the style used by the official puzzles.

   * [Assembly](assembly.html) is designed to carefully document the exact behavior of TIS-100 solutions, with an eye towards supporting emulators.  

   * [Save File Format](save.html) documents how TIS-100 saves solutions on disk. This may be useful to emulators wishing to load or create compatible save games.
